# Labyrinth
Build the Labyrinth and find the solution using BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Deep-First Search)

**Version 1.0** 

Contain basic opportunities:

  - to generate the Labyrinth with walls, tunnels, start point, finish point;
  - to write in a specific text file with the Labyrinth using the automation generation of the file name;
  - to find the solution to the Labyrinth using BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Deep-First Search). Show the path from the start point to the finish point, necessary steps and discovered nodes;
  - to read the Labyrinth from a specific text file without generation
  - to write the solution of the Labyrinth in a specific text file and an HTML file

**Version 2.0**

Added some new features:

- Different probability for  "walls" and "tunnels" is used  during the generation;
- Added constants: 
    METOD (to choose the generation method BFS or DFS);
    PROBABILITIES (to set the probability of "walls" and "tunnels" during the Labyrinth generation);
    BASIC_PART_FILENAME (to set the basic part of txt and html file name)
